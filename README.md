# Crohn-s-Disease-Genetics-Analysis
Analysis of genetic factors and oxidative stress pathways in Crohn's disease using transcriptomic data and computational modeling.

Key Findings
Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs): Identified numerous DEGs associated with Crohn's disease, including those involved in immune response, inflammatory signaling, and oxidative stress pathways.
Co-regulated Gene Clusters: Correlation analysis revealed clusters of genes that are co-regulated, indicating coordinated biological processes critical in Crohn's disease.
Oxidative Stress Relevance: Overlap analysis highlighted a significant intersection between DEGs and genes in ROS/Oxidative stress pathways, emphasizing the role of oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis.
Dynamic Insights from Computational Modeling: Simulations using the Crohn's IL6 Disease model provided dynamic insights into the behavior of molecular species, suggesting potential therapeutic targets.
Specific Gene Significance: Genes like IL6ST and NOD2 were further investigated due to their high correlation and known roles in inflammatory and immune responses, reinforcing their potential as therapeutic targets.
Discussion and Implications
This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease, emphasizing the interplay between gene expression changes, oxidative stress pathways, and immune dysregulation. The findings align with existing literature, strengthening the validity of the results.
The implications for basic science and clinical practice are significant:
Biological Insights: Enhanced understanding of disease pathophysiology.
Therapeutic Target Identification: Identification of key genes and pathways (e.g., IL-6 signaling, oxidative stress) as potential targets for novel treatment modalities.
Personalized Medicine: Potential for developing personalized therapeutic approaches based on genetic profiles and molecular signatures.
Limitations
Sample Size: Analysis may be limited by the sample size and heterogeneity of the dataset.
Data Quality: Accuracy relies on data quality and model assumptions; robust quality control is crucial.
Biological Complexity: Crohn's disease is multifactorial, and this analysis may not capture the full complexity, highlighting the need for integrative approaches.
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
code
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required Python packages:
code
Bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tellurium
(Note: For GEO2R, it's an online tool, so no installation is needed.)
Running the Code
Download the datasets:
Visit GSE261086 on GEO.
Download GSE261086_log2TPM.30.samples.Mucosa.txt.gz and GSE261086_log2TPM.30.samples.Wall.txt.gz.
Extract these files and place them in a data/ directory within your project.
Run the analysis scripts:
(Assuming you have Python scripts named data_preprocessing.py, deg_analysis.py, biomodels_simulation.py, correlation_analysis.py)
code
Bash
# Example commands (adjust as per your actual script names and structure)
python data_preprocessing.py
python deg_analysis.py
python biomodels_simulation.py
python correlation_analysis.py
The scripts will generate plots and CSV files in the designated output directories.
