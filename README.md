# Crohn's Disease Genetics Analysis

Analysis of genetic factors and oxidative stress pathways in Crohn's disease using transcriptomic data and computational modeling.

## Overview

This project investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease (CD), focusing on the relationship between gene expression changes and oxidative stress pathways. By integrating bioinformatic analysis and computational modeling, the project aims to identify key genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic targets for Crohn's disease. This research contributes to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and could inform the development of new treatment strategies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   **Code:**
    *   `analysis_script.py`:  This script is the central analysis pipeline. It orchestrates data loading, preprocessing, differential expression analysis (though results are loaded from external files), correlation analysis, and Venn diagram generation.  It utilizes results from GEO2R analysis.
    *   `biomodel_simulation.py`:  This script focuses on computational modeling using the Tellurium library.  It loads and simulates a BioModel (BIOMD0000000536), generating time-course plots of the species.
    *   `correlation_analysis.py`: This script performs the correlation analysis of the expression data, generates a correlation heatmap, and identifies key genes based on correlation.
    *   `visualization_hist_scatter_1.py`: This script generates histograms and scatter plots visualizing the distribution of ROS relevance scores, baseMean, and other relevant features from the merged dataset, and creates figures with names `distribution_of_baseMean_and_Relevance_Scores.png` and `ROS_Relevance_Score_vs_baseMean.png`.
    *   `visualization_hist_scatter_2.py`: This script creates histograms for ROS relevance scores, baseMean, and padj, and also generates scatter plots showing correlations. This script creates figures with name of `distribution_of_baseMean_Relevance_scores_and_padj.png`

*   **Data:**
    *   `DEGs_Crohns.csv`:  A CSV file containing the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs).  This file is the input for `correlation_analysis.py`. Columns include Gene Symbol, baseMean, log2FoldChange, pvalue, padj, etc.
    *   `ROS_gene.csv`: A CSV file listing genes associated with Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) pathways. Used in `correlation_analysis.py`. Columns include 'Gene Symbol', 'Description', 'Category', etc.
    *   `expression_data.csv`:  A CSV file containing normalized gene expression data used for correlation analysis. This is the input data for the correlation analysis in `correlation_analysis.py`. Columns include 'Gene Symbol' and the expression values for multiple samples.
    *   `merged_data1.csv`:  A CSV file containing merged data. This file is used for generating histograms and scatter plots in `visualization_hist_scatter_1.py` and `visualization_hist_scatter_2.py`. It is generated by the python scripts.
    *   GEO Dataset: GSE261086. The project utilizes data that has been processed from GSE261086. The processed data has been used to create the files used for the analysis.

*   **Figures:**
    *   `figures/venn_diagram.png`:  Venn diagram illustrating the overlap between DEGs and ROS pathway genes.  Generated by `correlation_analysis.py`.
    *   `figures/correlation_heatmap.png`: Heatmap visualizing the correlation matrix of gene expression.  Generated by `correlation_analysis.py`.
    *   `figures/distribution_of_baseMean_and_Relevance_Scores.png`: Histograms visualizing the distribution of baseMean and the relevance scores. Generated by `visualization_hist_scatter_1.py`
    *   `figures/ROS_Relevance_Score_vs_baseMean.png`: Scatter plots showing the ROS relevance score vs baseMean. Generated by `visualization_hist_scatter_1.py`
    *   `figures/distribution_of_baseMean_Relevance_scores_and_padj.png`: Plots of histograms and scatter plots showing the distribution of baseMean, relevance scores and padj values. Generated by `visualization_hist_scatter_2.py`
    *   `figures/biomodel_simulation_*.png`:  Time-course plots of the BioModel simulations, one plot per simulated species (e.g., `mwf626e95e_543f_41e4_aad4_c6bf60ab345b.png`).  Generated by `biomodel_simulation.py`.
    *   `figures/biomodel_species_ids.txt`: Text file with a list of the species IDs in the biomodel.  Generated by `biomodel_simulation.py`.
    *   Plots generated by GEO2R tool: `volcano_plot.png`, `mean_difference_plot.png`, `UMAP_plot.png`, `boxplot.png`, `p_value_histogram.png`, `mean_variance_trend_plot.png`.

### Analysis Methodology

The analysis followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Data was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO Accession: GSE261086) or has already been prepared in the data files. The samples were categorized into inflamed and non-inflamed conditions.
2.  **Differential Expression Analysis (DEA):**  The differential expression analysis was performed using the GEO2R tool. The results are loaded from `DEGs_Crohns.csv`.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between gene expression levels, using the `correlation_analysis.py` script.
4.  **Pathway Analysis:**  Not performed in this iteration.
5.  **Venn Diagram Generation:** A Venn diagram was generated to visualize the overlap between DEGs and genes related to ROS pathways, with the `correlation_analysis.py` file.
6.  **Biomodel Simulation:** The Crohn's IL6 Disease model (BIOMD0000000536) from the BioModels database was simulated to analyze the dynamics of key molecular species using the `biomodel_simulation.py` script.
7.  **Visualization:**  Figures were generated to visualize the results.

### Results

The analysis yielded the following key findings:

*   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with Crohn's disease.
*   Co-regulated gene clusters were identified, showing coordinated biological processes.
*   The overlap between DEGs and genes related to ROS/Oxidative stress pathways was demonstrated.
*   Dynamic insights into the behavior of molecular species implicated in Crohn's disease progression using computational modeling.

### Dependencies

The project utilizes the following libraries:

*   **Python:**
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `matplotlib`: For data visualization and plot creation.
    *   `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
    *   `tellurium`: For simulating the SBML model (BioModel).
    *   `matplotlib_venn`: for creating venn diagrams.
*   **Other:**
    *   SBML Model: BIOMD0000000536 from BioModels Database.
    *   GEO2R tool (for DEA on the GEO website)

### How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tellurium matplotlib-venn
    ```

2.  **Data Preparation:** Ensure that the data files (`DEGs_Crohns.csv`, `ROS_gene.csv`, `expression_data.csv`, and `merged_data1.csv`) are in the same directory as the Python scripts or adjust the file paths in the scripts accordingly. The `figures` and `data/processed` directories will be created automatically if they do not exist.

3.  **Run the Analysis Scripts:** Execute the analysis scripts in the order that data is created, which ensures any dependencies of the script are completed before the next one is run.

    ```bash
    python correlation_analysis.py
    python visualization_hist_scatter_1.py
    python visualization_hist_scatter_2.py
    python biomodel_simulation.py
    ```
