# Crohn-s-Disease-Genetics-Analysis
Analysis of genetic factors and oxidative stress pathways in Crohn's disease using transcriptomic data and computational modeling.

## Overview

This project investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease (CD), focusing on the relationship between gene expression changes and oxidative stress pathways. By integrating bioinformatic analysis and computational modeling, the project aims to identify key genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic targets for Crohn's disease. This research contributes to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and could inform the development of new treatment strategies.

## Analysis Methodology

The analysis followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  Downloaded and preprocessed gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO Accession: GSE261086).  Specifically, the data used was from the files `GSE261086_log2TPM.30.samples.Mucosa.txt.gz` and `GSE261086_log2TPM.30.samples.Wall.txt.gz`. The samples were categorized into inflamed and non-inflamed conditions.
2.  **Differential Expression Analysis (DEA):** Used the GEO2R tool (within the NCBI's GEO website) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the inflamed and non-inflamed groups.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between gene expression levels to identify co-expressed genes.  The correlation analysis was performed using the `analysis_script.py` file.
4.  **Pathway Analysis:** If applicable, describe any pathway enrichment analysis performed (e.g., using KEGG or Reactome databases) and the tools or libraries used.
5.  **Venn Diagram Generation:** Created a Venn diagram to visualize the overlap between DEGs and genes related to ROS pathways, with the `analysis_script.py` file.
6.  **Biomodel Simulation:** Used the Crohn's IL6 Disease model (BIOMD0000000536) from the BioModels database to simulate the dynamics of key molecular species. The `biomodel_simulation.py` script was used for this.
7.  **Visualization:** Generated various plots to visualize the results, including volcano plots, heatmaps, and time-course simulations using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).

## Results

The analysis yielded the following key findings:

*   Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with Crohn's disease, including genes involved in immune response, inflammatory signaling, and oxidative stress pathways.  These were visualized in the `volcano_plot.png` and `mean_difference_plot.png`.
*   Revealed co-regulated gene clusters indicative of coordinated biological processes in Crohn's disease.  This was highlighted by the `correlation_heatmap.png`.
*   Demonstrated the intersection between DEGs and genes related to ROS/Oxidative stress pathways through the Venn diagram (`venn_diagram.png`), suggesting a molecular link between gene expression and oxidative stress responses.
*   Provided dynamic insights into the behavior of molecular species implicated in Crohn's disease progression using computational modeling. Example time course plots can be found with names `mw...png`

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following libraries:

*   **Python:**
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization and plot creation.
    *   `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
    *   `tellurium`: For simulating the SBML model (BioModel).
*   **Other:**

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tellurium
    ```

2.  **Data Preparation:** Download the necessary data files (`.csv` and the data extracted from GEO). Place these files in the appropriate directory.
    *   Ensure that the files `DEGs_Crohns.csv`, `ROS_genes.csv`, `expression_data.csv`, and `merged_data1.csv` are in the same directory as `analysis_script.py` and the `biomodel_simulation.py`.
    *   The file for GEO2R analysis is not needed for running python scripts since we are using the results.

3.  **Run the Analysis Script:** Execute the `analysis_script.py` file, which will:
    *   Load the data.
    *   Perform the correlation and overlap analysis.
    *   Generate the figures and save them in the specified directory.

    ```bash
    python analysis_script.py
    ```

4.  **Run the Biomodel Simulation:** Execute the `biomodel_simulation.py` file, which will:
    *   Load the SBML model from the BioModels database.
    *   Simulate the model.
    *   Generate time-course plots and save them in the specified directory.

    ```bash
    python biomodel_simulation.py
    ```
